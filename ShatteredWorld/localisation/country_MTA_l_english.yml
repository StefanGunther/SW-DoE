 MTA_CSI:0 "Containment and Security Initiative"
 MTA_CSI_desc:0 "Maretania is the home of the Containment and Security Initiative, a worldwide underground operation to investigate, capture and secure powerful magical artifacts to make sure that they remain in responsible hooves. Strike forces serving the CSI consist of powerful trained mages who can take on platoons by themselves. Even then, it has been weakened by the Storm King’s recent rampage."
