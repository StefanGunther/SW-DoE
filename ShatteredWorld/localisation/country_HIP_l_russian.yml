 ### NAVY FOCUSES
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation:0 "Continue Navy Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_navy_modernisation_desc:0 "Although our navy is already one of the most powerful in the world, we cannot afford to be lax. We must ensure our navy is always ahead of the competition. As an island nation, the navy will determine whether we live or die."

 HIP_deep_blue_war_games:0 "Deep Blue War Games"
 HIP_deep_blue_war_games_desc:0 "A strong naval doctrine is essential to success. Traditionally we have favoured striking our enemies' ships when they are in ports, but we do have other doctrinal options available should we wish to change our course. No matter what, we must choose a path."

 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps:0 "Expand the Marines"
 HIP_expand_the_marine_corps_desc:0 "When we must invade other countries, it will be the marines who will lead the way, and the landing craft that will carry them to safety. Naval invasions are a nightmare, but with grit and determination we can prevail."

 HIP_freedom_ships:0 "Freedom Ships"
 HIP_freedom_ships_desc:0 "Our civilian shipping industry is invaluable to our continued development. By producing more convoys, we'll be able to trade with our friends regardless of enemy raiding. As an added bonus, readily available convoys will make naval invasions faster."

 HIP_naval_radar:0 "Shipboard Radar"
 HIP_naval_radar_desc:0 "Radar will let us spot enemy ships through the worst conditions nature can throw at us. Future models may even be able to locate submarines or calculate better firing trajectories."

 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee:0 "Form the Royal Shipbuilding Committee"
 HIP_royal_shipbuilding_committee_desc:0 "Our many shipbuilders are skilled but disorganized. Different styles, gun measurements, and even engine designs prevail across the country.

 HIP_seapony_squardrens:0 "Seapony Squadrons"
 HIP_seapony_squardrens_desc:0 "We have a long and storied history of the use of submarines. By forming dedicated squadrons of seaponies to crew them, we can quickly adapt to looming problems with design."

 HIP_underwater_supremacy:0 "Underwater Supremacy"
 HIP_underwater_supremacy_desc:0 "As a nation of seaponies, we can afford to invest even further in submarines. As our submarines don't have to carry air, we can hide like ghosts. Our submarines will strike at any troop transports and escape into the depths. No one will ever be able to take our home from us again!"

 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet:0 "Expand the Escort Fleet"
 HIP_expand_the_escort_fleet_desc:0 "When trading with other nations, it's absolutely critical to make sure our shipments arrive safely.

 HIP_battleship_primacy:0 "Battleship Primacy"

 HIP_imperious_class:0 "The Imperious Class Project"
 HIP_imperious_class_desc:0 "Our naval theorists have discussed a design for a new battleship. This proposed "super heavy battleship" will carry guns twenty-one meters long. It will no doubt be an enormous investment of resources, but when completed it will tear even the battleships of the future to shreds."

 HIP_air_sea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare"
 HIP_air_sea_warfare_desc:0 "As a people who can shift from soaring through the skies to swimming under the seas, it's only logical to focus our efforts on a navy that does the same. Pairing planes with boats will not only be a symbol of our unity, it will let us strike our enemies in their bases with ease!"

 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics:0 "Rapid Strike Tactics"
 HIP_rapid_strike_tactics_desc:0 "Our pilots will have to fly in quickly, execute their mission, and then return to the carrier to fuel up. We can accelerate this process by refuelling and reequipping in the air."

 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee:0 "Naval Aeronautics Committee"
 HIP_naval_aeronautics_committee_desc:0 "With our new focus on carriers, we will also need to modernize our carrier planes. Forming a Naval Aeronautics Committee will help us move boldly into the future and strike any navy that dares oppose us."

 ### INDUSTRY FOCUSES
 HIP_seapony_primacy:0 "Seapony Primacy"
 HIP_seapony_primacy_desc:0 "We survived the Storm King's invasion by hiding underwater. The sea shelters us, and it must be the sea we rely upon going forward. Even with modern submarines, our enemies can't reach the sea floor, so we'll always have a safe place to flee to."

 HIP_hippogriff_primacy:0 "Hippogriff Primacy"
 HIP_hippogriff_primacy_desc:0 "We can't afford to cower in the depths any longer. The world is changing, and if we are to take our place as a preeminent nation among the peoples of the world, it's time to change too."

 HIP_shell_oil:0 "Shell Oil Company"
 HIP_shell_oil_desc:0 "Although we have a reasonable amount of crude oil, it isn't enough to fuel our massive navy. We'll need to develop our oil refining process, and synthetic refineries are also worth looking into."
 
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry:0 "Support the Oil Industry"
 HIP_support_the_oil_industry_desc:0 "There's only so far we can get with improving refining. A great wealth of oil lies under the ocean floor, and we can tap into it with modern extraction. Synthetic oil has also been developed by some other countries of the world, and would help us supplant our natural reserves."

 HIP_national_road_network:0 "National Road Network"
 HIP_national_road_network_desc:0 "By constructing a nationwide road network, we can speed up all our future construction. It'll also be useful for supplying any military operations. It will move our society in favor of hippogriffs, however."

 HIP_underwater_railways:0 "Underwater Railways"
 HIP_underwater_railways_desc:0 "Building underwater rails will make future underwater construction much faster, and even help us build things on the surface should we desire to. It will move our society in favor of seaponies, however."

 HIP_department_of_commerce:0 "Form the Department of Commerce"
 HIP_department_of_commerce_desc:0 "While we are a modern nation, the fact remains that as the world changes at breakneck speed, we run the risk of being left behind. If we are to safeguard our technological advantage, we need to keep advancing."

 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences:0 "Open the Office of Industrial Sciences"
 HIP_office_of_industral_sciences_desc:0 "There are so many topics we can be investigating, from machinery to electronics to battleships to our own biology. We need to open a new branch of the government dedicated exclusively to research and innovation. This Office of Industrial Sciences will ensure we are never behind our peers."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine:0 "Mine Bauxite in Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Airplanes require aluminium, and our armed forces require a mighty airforce. Our geologists have reported there are massive piles of aluminium in Alaudia. Although it will take time and effort, the rewards will be immense."

 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks:0 "Develop Starfield Steelworks"
 HIP_develop_starfield_steelworks_desc:0 "Nearly everything we produce needs steel, from shovels to battleships. Starfield is the center of our refining of iron ore into steel, so it's only logical to expand production there."

 HIP_defence_department_desc:0 "In a world filled with threats, we will need a strong army to safeguard our borders. This Department will both cover our army's modernisation and its central administration."

 HIP_modern_weapon_contests:0 "Modern Weaponry Contests"
 HIP_modern_weapon_contests_desc:0 "By holding contests for the best-designed guns and grenades, we can ensure top-of-the-line performance for all our troops. Soldiers are in short supply, so our guns have to be the best we can possibly make them."

 HIP_army_armament_bonds:0 "Armanent Bonds"
 HIP_army_armament_bonds_desc:0 "Selling bonds will help us raise the money to build weapons factories. In the event we're attacked, it'll also let us quickly liquidate our funds to shift civilian factories to military ones."

 HIP_continue_army_modernisation:0 "Continue Army Modernisation"
 HIP_continue_army_modernisation_desc:0 "As a small nation, we have always believed that our first and foremost priority for the army should be better guns than our foes. Some military theorists advocate for changing our course, while others say that what has served us well should remain. Either way, keeping our theory of war modern is absolutely critical in these times."

 HIP_fund_royal_island:0 "Fund the Royal Island Gunworks"
 HIP_fund_royal_island_desc:0 "We have long used cannons in our armies. Big guns let us blast our enemies from afar, keeping our own troops safe. Having Royal Island design new artillery will let us prepare for whatever our enemies throw at us!"

 HIP_army_motorisation:0 "Motorising the Army"

 HIP_royal_engineers_corps_desc:0 "Combat engineers can dig trenches, set explosives to breach forts, and operate flamethrowers to smoke our foes out. We must not neglect our engineers, especialyl the defenses they can give to protect our home."

 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school:0 "A School for Signals and Logistics"
 HIP_signle_and_logistics_school_desc:0 "Modern warfare involves more than guns and planes; it also involves distribution of goods and quick communication. Creating a school dedicated to these less visible but still vital topics will make sure we can synchronize and plan with lightning speed."

 HIP_invite_griffon_officers:0 "Invite Griffon Theorists"
 HIP_invite_griffon_officers_desc:0 "The Griffonian school of war has long been that maximal planning and preparation is the method by which victory is won. We can approach them for guidance on our own war machine to help us organize properly."

 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy:0 "Lessons from the Enemy"
 HIP_lessons_from_the_enemy_desc:0 "The Storm King's tactics were brutal yet effective. Rapidly organized plans and swift offensives let him conquer most of Zebrica, and doing the same could let us take the fight to any would-be conquerors."

 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds:0 "Training Grounds at Grand Alaudia"
 HIP_grand_alaudia_training_grounds_desc:0 "Grand Alaudia has both jungles and plains, and it's respectably distant from Mount Aris. Summoning our entire army there to practice war games, and then conducting extensive surveys on the experience of both foot soldiers and generals, will help us reorganize our army and refine our military doctrine."

 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare:0 "Air-to-Ground Warfare"
 HIP_air_to_ground_warfare_desc:0 "Paratroopers can land behind enemy lines and quickly disrupt their flow of supply. If we can capture their capitals and industrial centers, we might be able to win wars without ever firing a shot."

 HIP_special_service_force:0 "Special Forces Concentration"
 HIP_special_service_force_desc:0 "Special forces, from mountaineers to paratroopers to even more exotic possibilities like amphibious tanks, are a defining part of the [HIP.GetAdjective] military.

 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school:0 "Jungle Special Forces School"
 HIP_jungle_special_forces_school_desc:0 "Jungles are a nightmare to fight on for everyone. However, we have many jungles across our lands, and by training troops in jungle warfare, we can give our special forces a deadly edge in this dangerous terrain."

 HIP_mountain_warfare_school:0 "Mountain Warfare School"
 HIP_mountain_warfare_school_desc:0 "Mountaineers are a necessity on on any mountain terrain, and as our capital lies atop a great mountain, we'll need to invest heavily to protect it. Mountaineers can make the ost of our home, securing it against any attack."

 HIP_national_defence_draft:0 "National Defence Draft"
 HIP_national_defence_draft_desc:0 "In these terrifying times, we have to take drastic measures. [HIP.GetLeader] has, after extensive deliberation, decided to institute a limited draft.

 HIP_royal_legion_of_aris:0 "The Royal Legion of Aris"

 HIP_air_armament_committee_desc:0 "As the world recovers from the Storm King's defeat, it's more important than ever to make sure we have a strong air force to keep our people safe.

 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus:0 "Air-Land Warfare"
 HIP_air_land_warfare_focus_desc:0 "Any war must ultimately be won on land. By focusing our air force around winning land battles, we can push our enemies back whenever they advance, securing our borders forever."

 HIP_tactical_bombing:0 "Tactical Bomber Initiative"
 HIP_tactical_bombing_desc:0 "While we favor close air support to win land battles, tactical bombers are a necessity to cover other operations. They can execute any mission with reasonable effectiveness, from strategic bombing to close air support, and are thus wonderfully flexible."

 HIP_escort_fighters:0 "Escort Fighters"
 HIP_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Our bombers will need protection. Whether strategic bombers deep in enemy territory or CAS striking our straits, heavy fighters can reach across vast distances and defend bombers from local planes."

 HIP_fighter_working_group:0 "Fighter Working Group"
 HIP_fighter_working_group_desc:0 "Enemy bombers will inevitably target our homes and factories. We swam underwater to escape the Storm King's armies, but as much of our industry is on land, doing so is immensely costly. Building fighters will let us engage bombers before they strike our land."

 HIP_young_flyers_programme:0 "Young Fliers Program"
 HIP_young_flyers_programme_desc:0 "Are you doing your part? Our air force is the shield against our foes' bombs and the spear we ready against their charges. If we make this clear to our people, we're bound to have many young hippogriffs flocking to the air force!"

 HIP_rocketry_school:0 "Department of Rocketry"
 HIP_rocketry_school_desc:0 "Rockets—self-propelled missiles packed with liquid or solid fuel—have the potential to strike a base in the [CHN.GetName] from the comfort of our own mountain. A way to wage war without a single hippogriff or seapony ever having to leave home is incredibly tempting for obvious reasons. We need to find out more!"

 HIP_atom_committee:0 "Atomic Committee"
 HIP_atom_committee_desc:0 "Our scientists have long known that matter is made up of atoms. Recent findings suggest that certain atoms, in particular uranium and plutonium, can be split, and that such an event, properly controlled, could cause a chain reaction, unleashing incalculable destruction and loss of civilian life. We don't want to kill innocents, of course, but even having such a weapon could prove a mighty deterrant. In the long run, this weapon could aid the cause of peace."

 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine:0 "Strategic Obliteration Doctrine"
 HIP_strategic_obliteration_doctraine_desc:0 "Victory in war can only be achieved by the total obliteration of our enemy's capability to wage war.

 HIP_self_efficency:0 "Seapony Autarky"
 HIP_self_efficency_desc:0 "Hippogriffia survived for centuries on its own, and it would be beyond irresponsible to abandon this policy.

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee"
 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_desc:0 "Stalliongrad, Chiropterra, Griffonia, the Stormlanders: foreign ideologies and interests can be found everywhere, and many of these are driven by interests directly opposed to ours.

 HIP_leand_lease:0 "Lend-Lease"
 HIP_leand_lease_desc:0 "Even if we cannot directly aid our friends in war, we can still make sure they are given the tools needed to finish the job. Our factories stand ready to churn out countless weapons needed, and our friends will have access to it for the lowest price we can charge."

 HIP_the_mountain_awakes:0 "The Mountain Awakes"
 HIP_the_mountain_awakes_desc:0 "We were asleep, but now we have awaken. The mountain is no longer silent, but it resonates with the sound of labour and preperations. Beware, all who would threaten us. We are ready for you, and we will be your undoing."

 HIP_youth_defence_league:0 "The Youth Defense League"
 HIP_youth_defence_league_desc:0 "We would never place our children in harms way, but in war there are many duties necessary, including several that will keep them able to aid in the struggle, but still remain out of the way of the actual fighting."

 HIP_never_to_fall_again:0 "As the War Approaches"

 HIP_trade_ports_desc:0 "Contrary to what some claim, we are not looking to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the outside world. The cities of Winggarden, Howlington, and Canterford will be dedicated to trade with the outside world, and through it we can still be part of the world while watching its influence on us."

 HIP_agricultral_reforms:0 "Agricultural Reforms"
 HIP_agricultral_reforms_desc:0 "The agricultural sector has been left languishing in recent times. With all the development both internally and abroad, the time has come for a dedicated effort to make sure that our farmers can keep feeding our people even if the worst happens."

 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape:0 "Cut the Industrial Red Tape"
 HIP_cut_industral_red_tape_desc:0 "Our industry suffers from miles upon miles of red tape. It might have been well-intentioned, but it is simply stifling us.

 # Zebrica Mandate Focuses

 HIP_encourage_migration_desc:0 "Ain Trotgourait is a wonderful place to live. Why should we deny our citizens freedom of movement in our own land?

 HIP_wingnot_accords:0 "Revisit the Wingnot Accords"
 HIP_wingnot_accords_desc:0 "Our mandate was only ever meant to be a temporary measure to ensure the security of Hippogriffia and Zumidia. It's time to meet with Zumidian community leaders at their historic Wingnot Palace to work out the future hoof in claw."

 ### DECISIONS ###
 HIP_underwater_construction_cat:0 "Underwater Construction"
 HIP_underwater_construction_cat_desc:0 "Seaquestria is a vast underwater realm that's almost untouchable to surface-dwellers. Few even know it is there. Its cities on the sea floor are just as large and developed as those on the surface, and the seaponies are masters of life under the waves. While building industry underwater may seem odd at first, it would be foolish to not include half our nation in our economic growth. So long as our kingdom remains united, we will both prosper, with the right investments.\n\nCurrent Underwater Buildings:\nCivilian Factories: [?HIP_underwater_civ|Y0]\nMilitary Factories: [?HIP_underwater_mil|Y0]\nNaval Dockyards: [?HIP_underwater_dockyard|Y0]\nSynthetic Refineries: [?HIP_underwater_refinery|Y0]\nFuel Silos: [?HIP_underwater_fuel_silo|Y0]"

 HIP_anti_harmonic_activities_committee_cat_desc:0 "The Anti-Harmonic Activities Committee has been established with two goals in mind: Ensure the continued unity of hippogriffs and seaponies, and prevent foreign ideas that could damage the fabric of society from crossing our borders.\n\nThe more powers given the more they can do to achieve that goal. However, if given too many powers the committee might become something more than intended."

 ### EVENTS ###
 hippogriff.1.t: "Hurricane!"
 hippogriff.1.d: "A devastating hurricane with sustained winds over 220 kilometers per hour slammed into Hippogriffia from Warzena and Chiropterra, with the heaviest damage done to East Aris. Although our ability to shift between hippogriffs and seaponies let us avoid any deaths due to flooding, it provided no protection against the trees hurled through the air or the gusts slamming us into walls. The death toll is thankfully low, although the property damage is devastating. The economic impact of this disaster cannot yet be calculated, and many seaponies are using it as an evidence that the surface is too dangerous."
 hippogriff.1.a: "So much destruction..."

 ### LEADERS #####
 HIP_POSADA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of May, 980 in Seaquestria.\n\n§YBiography§!: For most of her childhood, Posada was ostracised by her peers. But she liked it that way, it left her more time to explore and play with her imaginary friends. She became an apprentice bookmaker in her teenaged years and later joined her local finball team eventually representing her hometown at the Pan-Seaquestrian Finball Cup. When she first went to the surface, she looked upon the starts in wonder and often would spend a lot of her time sitting on clouds at night stargazing. It was on one such night she accidently drifted over towards Zebrican territory and was captured by the Storm King's forces.\n\nPosada was chained inside the cargo hold of an airship full of looted trophies and treasures from Colthage. During the long journey she suffered at the hands of her yeti captors, but one night she was able to break free of her shackles. Sneaking through the ship's hold, she was seeking to make a quick escape and then follow the stars home when a flash of green light caught her attention.\n\nThe light ebbed from out the crack in the lid of a large golden chest intricately carved with images of horned beasts and bowing goats. Unable to help herself, she broke the chains and opened the lid. What she saw would change her forever. Images flashed before her eyes. Images of things nogriff should ever know. Great cities unlike any she's ever known, full of strange bipedal beings. Images of conflict, strife, poverty and the stars, so many stars. She saw galaxies all at once at the scale of atoms. She saw the raw power of the stars. Their blinding light and warming glow. The burning ball of atoms that would purge worlds of evil.\n\nIt is unknown how she returned to Hippogriffia. Her mind was broken, and it was months before she could talk in coherent sentences again. Shortly after the storm King's defeat, a copy of the works of Caramel Marks crossed her desk at work. She found the book as a symbol that she was destined to unlock the secret powers the chest had shown her and to free everycreature from the shackles of capitalism and monarchy. She founded the Revolutionary Workers' Party and quickly started preaching her ideology to every hippogriff and seapony she could.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:  AaronMK"
